#### Emeriti

We thank all our prior Steering Committee members for their contribution:

| Name         | Affiliation | Member term began | Member term ended |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Eleni Rundle | Google      | 3/29/2023         | 10/09/2023        |

One of the more important duties of the Steering Committee is the approval of the Specifications and other works produced as a consensus product of the FOCUS Working Groups.

  The FOCUS Steering Committee is initially composed of a representative of the founding members of the Organization and it has a single primary member representing each company. Additional Steering Committee members will be appointed by the FinOps Foundation Governing Board as specified in the FOCUS Project Governance document.

  Each Steering Committee meeting is called on a regular interval, although this interval can be ad-hoc as long as the proper notice is given.

  Proper notice of the FOCUS Steering Committee meeting is given to its representatives including an agenda with the topics to be voted by the Steering Committee having been prepared with a proper notice period - 7 days.

  A quorum of 51% of the Steering Committee is required for a vote to proceed.

  Motions are made and accepted by a vote of the designated Steering Committee members. Members may debate the motion, make changes if thought fit, accept or reject the motion. It is an important principle that there is an opportunity for questions and clarifications of the motion in the process.

  The votes are taken only by the appointed representatives of the Steering Committee. Minutes of the meeting are taken to record the attendance, votes and their outcomes.

### Becoming a FOCUS Steering Committee Member

Section 3 of the [Project Charter](FOCUS_-_Membership_Agreement_Package_for_use.pdf) describes the composition of the Steering Committee. Membership levels of Member organizations are managed by the FinOps Foundation and Steering Committee memberships are voted on and approved by the FinOps Foundation Governing Board.


### Steering Committee Membership Criteria

  The FinOps Foundation Governing Board has set the following criteria for the FOCUS Project Steering Committee make up.

  Criteria for appointment to the FOCUS Steering Committee from among FOCUS Members:
  *  One member from the F2 Staff/Linux Foundation to initialize the project
  *  At least 2 should represent Cloud Service Providers as producers of cloud billing data
  *  At least 2 should be Premier Members of FinOps Foundation
  *  At least 2 should be Consumers of the FOCUS work outputs and cloud billing data

  FinOps Foundation Governing Board designates all FOCUS Steering Committee members. The FinOps Foundation Governing Board may add/remove FOCUS Steering Committee members and reserve the right to alter the criteria.

### Security policy

Security concerns that impact repos under the [FOCUS GitHub org](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec) (including reference implementations and official tools) may be responsibly disclosed to the Steering Committee via any current Steering Committee member, with the expectation that they will be discussed and triaged by the Steering Committee as a whole. You may reach a subset of current Steering Committee members via [focus@finops.org](mailto:focus@finops.org).
 
Our goal is to provide complete, accurate, and actionable disclosures once a reported issue has been sufficiently understood and there has been a reasonable opportunity to deploy fixes responsibly. At no time should a Steering Committee member release information on a pre-disclosed vulnerability to anyone besides other Steering Committee members, Foundation staff, legal counsel, or required authorities unless there is consensus to do so. A Steering Committee member may call for a formal vote to determine an appropriate path forward at any time in the process, if needed.

In the case of responsible disclosures, the Steering Committee is expected to work in good faith toward a resolution that is in the best interest of the community, including coordinating with maintainers on pre-disclosure patches and the CVE process. As responsible and knowledgeable stewards of the FOCUS ecosystem, the Steering Committee is empowered to negotiate the priority level and timelines for announcements and fixes.

In the case of irresponsible disclosure, regardless of the circumstances, the Steering Committee is expected to make themselves available to convene urgently and to decide upon a communications and action plan.
